Only a small assemblage, a mere 5%, doth reap riches from these arcane arts. The rest languish, their coffers untouched by AI's promise. Tools, such as ChatGPT, find favor amongst many, yet transform little. The key lies not in grand models, but in systems that learn and remember. Successful pioneers customize these tools to align with workflows and procure great reward, whilst others remain ensnared by static devices. Thus, the path to cross this divide requireth much wisdom and thoughtful partnership with vendors bearing adaptable solutions.\n",
